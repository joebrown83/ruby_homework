ror Homework Assignment#2

You should be able to execute everything just fine by first running the db_generator.rb file to create the university_db.yml file.  Then you can run the db_client.rb to run the queries.

I did not need to create the methods described in #11 on the student class in order to get the intersection to work.  I am unclear about what they are needed for. The rest of the assignment was fine.  It did take me a little while to figure out the yaml piece to it. The Pickaxe book doesn't do a great job with explaining how to use the yaml file once you've read it in to a variable.
